1. Project Nature
This is a static Web3 educational website, similar in structure to roadmap.sh and Wikipedia.
Purpose: To introduce Web3 concepts (e.g. decentralisation, chains, wallets, industries) to beginners in an engaging and editable format.

2. AI Prompt Behaviour
Always interpret prompts within the context of this specific project.
Do not suggest backend-heavy, dynamic server-based solutions unless explicitly asked.
Focus on static site generation, on-chain-friendly models, and Web3-aligned design decisions.
All user interactions (edits, undos, submissions) must respect decentralised and audit-friendly principles.

3. Editing & Content Contribution
Users are allowed to edit content, similar to Wikipedia.
Use soft editing/deleting:
    No content is ever permanently removed.
    All actions (edit, delete, undo) are recorded immutably (on-chain or in a cryptographic log).
Edits should be signed with the user’s wallet address.

4. Admin & Governance
The system may have admins, but:
Admins have limited power (e.g. moderation, structure adjustment).
Prefer DAO-style governance or multisig control over content approval or site structure changes.
Admins must not override users silently — all admin actions are public and recorded.

5. Undo / Restore Logic
Users who deleted or edited content may undo their own actions.
Undo does not erase history — it simply reverses the visibility state.
Every change must be:
    Versioned
    Attributable (by wallet address)
    Publicly auditable

6. On-Chain Strategy
The system is Web3-aligned, not fully on-chain.
Core content may be hosted statically, while:
    Edits and history are logged on-chain or via verifiable commit hash structures. 
Always prioritise transparency and immutability over centralised control.

7. Content Integrity
Once published, content cannot be silently changed.
Each update must:
    Public → Everyone can see what was changed and when.
    Signed → Your wallet address is recorded as the author of the change.
    Tracked → The system keeps a history of edits (like version control).
    Immutable → Old versions aren’t deleted; they’re archived and traceable.

8. UI Design 
Minimalist Approach
    Clean layouts with purposeful whitespace optimization create breathing room and focus attention on essential elements.
Contemporary Typography
    Elegant serif fonts paired with strategic sizing create readable, sophisticated text hierarchies.
Accessible Color Contrast
    Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratios for normal text and 3:1 for large text to ensure readability for all users.
Consistent Patterns
    Apply uniform spacing, border radius, and component styling across all interface elements.
